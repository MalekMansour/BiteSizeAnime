## Anime Website Setup Instructions

For security reasons, we cannot directly upload video files here. However, you can follow these instructions to make the website fully functional.

### Organize Anime Episodes:

1. Create a folder for each anime series, naming it after the anime.
2. Inside each anime folder, name each episode file following the pattern: `episode1.mp4`, `episode2.mp4`, and so on.
3. Ensure that all video files are in the MP4 format for compatibility.

#### Example:

Assuming you have an anime titled "MyAnimeShow," your folder structure might look like this:

* MyAnimeShow
    * episode1.mp4
    * episode2.mp4
    * episode3.mp4
